SMART CITY INFRASTRUCTURE MONITORING USING IOT AND CLOUD COMPUTING 🌉

Project Overview 📋

This project aims to enhance the safety and efficiency of city infrastructure by developing an IoT-based solution that monitors critical infrastructure like bridges, roads, tunnels, and public utilities in real time. IoT sensors continuously track key parameters such as vehicle count, road traffic spee, and differenbt sorts of emissions, while data is transmitted to the cloud for analysis and storage. Predictive analytics help identify potential problems before they escalate, and real-time alerts enable city officials to take immediate action. Cloud integration allows for centralized monitoring of multiple assets, making the system scalable as cities grow

User Stories 🧑‍💻

1. As a city official, I want to receive real-time alerts when infrastructure conditions (e.g., bridge vibrations or road degradation) exceed safe limits, so I can dispatch emergency repairs 🚨
2. As a city planner, I want to monitor the health of all infrastructure assets remotely from a central dashboard, ensuring that I can optimize maintenance schedules 🛠️
3. As a city auditor, I want access to compliance reports that provide a detailed history of infrastructure monitoring and maintenance activities to ensure regulatory requirements are met 📝
